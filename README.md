Portfolio Reflection
Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The DriverPass project was designed for a company that wanted to create an online system to help students prepare for and pass their driving tests. The client needed a system where students could take online classes, schedule on-the-road lessons, access practice tests, and track their training progress. They also needed different user roles for students, secretaries, administrators, and IT officers to manage accounts, appointments, and reports.

What did you do particularly well?
I feel that I did a good job clearly identifying the client's needs and turning them into specific system requirements. I also created detailed UML diagrams that helped visualize how different parts of the system would interact. My documents stayed organized and made it easy to see how the system would work from start to finish.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
If I could revise one part, I would improve my UML activity diagrams by making them more detailed. I would include more decision points and error handling paths to better represent what happens when users make mistakes or when the system encounters problems.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I carefully read through the interview transcript and highlighted the key tasks and features the client wanted. I then made sure those needs were directly reflected in my business requirements and system design. Considering the user's needs is important because if the system does not match what the users expect, it will not be successful. A system should solve real problems and make tasks easier for its users.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
When designing software, I break the project into smaller parts, define the main goals, and plan the system’s structure using diagrams like UML use cases, activities, sequences, and classes. In the future, I would continue using diagrams early in the process, involve users by getting feedback sooner, and focus more on how the system can adapt over time to new needs.
